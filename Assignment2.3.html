<div> "My life changed because of Lname Foods. I remember the first time I walked into the store my back problems instantly fixed themselves, the wart on my nose shrinked and I won the lottery. The food was so amazing, especially the lotus rib soup and the hotpot special. 10/10 would recommend." </div><br><br>

<div> "I had this one tofu soup that was very good, especially the kimchi flavouring in the soup. It was really brothy. 7.8/10 to0 much water." </div>
<div> (I hope you get this reference TA!) </div><br><br>

<div> "I have gone here a few times, what I really liked about this store is that they catered to my allergies. I am allergic to carrots and the thing about most foods is they have a small amount of carrots - really annoying! Props to the store owners for being conscious!" </div><br><br>

<div> "I have been eating at Lname Foods for many years now. My favorite dish is by far stinky tofy. I've been all over the world and I've never had any stinky tofu this good. The other dishes are fabulous as well." </div><br><br>
