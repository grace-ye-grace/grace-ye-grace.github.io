<div id="about">
    <p> It all started with a food truck, two college students, and a dream to make the best foods in all of Rockport. Now, we are the number one best dish provider in all of The Universe. We sold the food truck and bought a food spaceship so we can bring our food to everyone on every planet and every star, including The Sun. Almost got burned at that location, so the solar flares will have to take a road trip if they want our food again.</p>
    <p> We are on the brink of what's tommorow. </p>
