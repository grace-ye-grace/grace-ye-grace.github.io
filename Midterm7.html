        <p class="white">"I took the Food Tour trip and we went to various joints, such
        as ChaTime, Dumpling Cafe, and Mike's Pastries. The samples from each place were perfectly sized and delicious!
        Boston really does have the best Clam Chowder. Besides that, after we got ice
        cream samplers as the final part, the Cicada Bus flew over the harbor as the
        sun set. I will never forget that day."</p>
        <br>
        <p class="white">"The College Tours of Boston trip gave me horrifying flashbacks to the college
          application process, but it is hard to deny how beautiful the campuses are here.
          We flew over Boston University, Northeastern University, Berklee College of Music,
          and drove over the bridge connecting MIT and Cambridge to the rest of Boston.
          The funny thing is some high school students on the trip were clearly using the
          tour as an opportunity to take notes on the campuses and if they liked them or
          not. Whether you're applying or not, however, this is a really cool experience."

        <p class="white">"I took the VIP tour, which was 5 hours long and gave a detailed insight into
           every part of Boston. The trip was phenomenal honestly, especially the part where
           the Cicada Bus did donuts in the sky. I also learned a nice amount of
           history through the trip, such as landmark locations important
           to the Revolutionary War. One person on the trip actually got out
           when we passed the Freedom Trail so he could walk it!
           My only complaint was one of those food samples we got - I believe it was called bobba?
           It sucked and I nearly choked on one of the things inside. Overall, though,
           the trip was unique. Never have I been in one vehicle that can do so much for
           so cheap, so even if you don't like Boston that much, this trip is worth its
           weight in gold."
